# 📱 Data Usage Prediction

## 👋 Introduction

Hello everyone!  
Mobile phones have become an essential part of modern life — transforming how we communicate, work, learn, and socialize. With the explosion in mobile data usage, smartphones are now central to our daily routines. From streaming and social media to online shopping and remote work, they influence almost every aspect of our lives.

As technology continues to evolve, so does our dependence on smartphones. I often wondered how people spend so much time on their devices without feeling exhausted. In particular, mobile gaming has become a global phenomenon — sparking my curiosity to explore user behavior across platforms and how it affects internet consumption.

This project was inspired by my personal experiences. Sometimes I spend hours on my phone and begin to question how others manage even longer usage. I believe smartphones, when used wisely, can promote personal growth — but if misused, can lead to stagnation.

> **So in other words, our smartphones should be responsible for our growth — not our distraction.**

### 🔁 Workflow Steps:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Open-source dataset used for capturing real mobile usage behavior.

2. **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Normalizing data  
   - Filtering unnecessary noise

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding trends and user behavior  
   - Visualizing time spent, device usage, gender ratio, etc.

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Analyzing battery consumption, app usage, session lengths

5. **Model Creation & Prediction**  
   - Predicting user behavior  
   - Analyzing factors influencing heavy phone use

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Android users** tend to consume **more battery time** than iOS users.
- There are **more male users** than female users in the dataset.
- Usage time correlates with type of activity (e.g., gaming vs. messaging).

> These insights help us understand not just how long people use their phones, but *why*.
