Data Usage Prediction


  
Hello guys!
Mobile phones have become an essential part of modern life, transforming the way we communicate, work, learn, and socialize. With the explosion of mobile data usage, we rely on our smartphones not just for calls and texts, but for a vast array of activities. From streaming content, social media, and navigation to online shopping and remote work, our mobile devices are now at the heart of daily routines. 
In a world when technology is versed and spreading like wild-fire, I discovered that the use of mobile device has grown and had some effect on human daily life to life activities. I always thought how people can use their smartphones for a long period of time without getting stressed out by any means, and I realized some people spend more time on video games due to circular video game across the glob in our current day’s and I very gave it a thought to analyze and see different people behaviors and how they use their mobile phones, collecting some data from an open source platform using the data to get meaningful insight to how people use their smartphones and how it affect the internet.
Taking up this project was because certain times I spent hours on my mobile phone and thought how does it feel to last longer than I stayed on my smartphone, using smartphone has certain advantages on our daily life if maximized well, hence it Cause a huge Disadvantages on our daily life.
So-in other word’s our smartphones should be responsible for our growth and not our stagnation.
 
According to research:
As of 2024, over 5 billion people worldwide use mobile phones, with an increasing reliance on smartphones for daily tasks. This represents a significant portion of the global population, reflecting how integral mobile devices have become in modern life. Furthermore, more than 3.5 billion of these users access the internet via their mobile phones, underscoring the shift towards mobile-first experiences for communication, shopping, and entertainment. Smart phones also account for over 50% of global internet traffic, with people spending an average of 4 hours per day on their devices, checking them approximately 58 times daily. This widespread use of mobile phones has reshaped how we interact with the world, from managing finances and shopping to staying connected socially, all contributing to both convenience and potential challenges such as digital overload.
Process 
	Collection of data for analysis (open-source Library)

	Statistical Analysis
	Model creation and predictions etc.
Analysis
	Having Analyzed The user’s behavior, I can say those who uses android tends to consume more battery time than Ios operating system users.
          
	And also, from my analysis I could see that we have more male user than female user which uses their smartphones.
